## 🚨 Identified Vulnerabilities

| #  | Vulnerability                 | Risk Level |
|----|-------------------------------|------------|
| 1️⃣ | Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)     | High       |
| 2️⃣ | SQL Injection                 | Critical   |
| 3️⃣ | Missing Security Headers      | Medium     |
| 4️⃣ | Sensitive File Enumeration    | Medium     |
| 5️⃣ | Broken Static Assets (404s)   | Low        |

---

## 🛡️ Recommendations

- 🔒 **Input Validation**: Sanitize + encode all user inputs
- 🔐 **Auth Handling**: Use prepared statements / ORM
- 🧱 **Headers**: Use `helmet` in Express
- 🚫 **Access Control**: Block internal path access
- 🧂 **Passwords**: Use hashing (bcrypt/scrypt)
- 📦 **Asset Mgmt**: Fix broken links/static paths

---

## 📈 Conclusion

> The application is **At-Risk** with critical vulnerabilities present. Immediate patching is advised, followed by a full code review and re-testing 🔁.
